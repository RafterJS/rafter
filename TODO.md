Rafter TODO
=============
- [x] Monorepo to handle core and other dependencies
- [x] A babel preset package
- [x] An eslint preset package
- [x] A plugin architecture
- [ ] "create react app" style boilerplate

- [ ] Create CI pipelines for PRs

- [ ] Create tests for existing services in CORE
- [ ] Fix config merging
- [ ] Disambiguate DI `config` from plugin or app `config`
