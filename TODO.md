Rafter TODO
=============
- [x] Monorepo to handle core and other dependencies
- [x] A babel preset package
- [x] An eslint preset package
- [ ] A plugin architecture
- [ ] "create react app" style boilerplate
- [ ] Example of middleware being autoloaded
- [ ] An example of a "modern" app eg using React, GraphQL Api

### Smaller tasks
- [ ] Convert the babel package to js. This is because babel is missing types which is causing errors.
